# README

This bug tracker is a learning experience and should not be used in a production environment. That being said, it should be good enough for most small projects and especially good for very small teams.

It is not so much feature free, but more distraction less. 

The idea is to enter bugs quickly into the system, not to create work managing the bugs or worrying about blaming people.

As a fun aside, this project began life as a fun idea for sharing funny sheep videos on the web (EweTube) but quickly became a bug tracker in a very meta way. This is why bugs are called sheep and why developers may be counting sheep in order to fall asleep every night. :)
